## 🧮 Normalization Procedure

> **📌 Summary:**  
> As part of optimizing the database design, a normalization audit was conducted and documented in `normalization.md`.

> **⚠️ Issue Identified:**  
> The original `properties` table violated **First Normal Form (1NF)** due to the `location` attribute potentially storing non-atomic data (e.g., full addresses or compound region-city values).

> **🔍 Deeper Impact:**  
> Further analysis showed this affected compliance with **2NF** and **3NF**, as some attributes were not fully or directly dependent on the primary key.

> **✅ Resolution:**  
> - A new `locations` table was introduced to store atomic, reusable location data (`city`, `street`).
> - The `properties` table was updated to reference `locations` via a `location_id` foreign key.

> **📂 Reference:**  
> For full details and revised table structures, refer to the file `normalization.md`.

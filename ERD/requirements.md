 # Entity Relationship Diagram for Airbnb Clone Project

This document outlines the key entities and their attributes for the Airbnb clone project. It defines relationships between entities and their respective cardinalities.  

The visual representation of the ER diagram is saved as `erd_diagram.png`.  
The declarative database structure is defined in `airbnb.dbml`, which contains all entity definitions and relationships in DBML format.

## 🧑‍💼 User Entity

The `users` table stores details of all people who use the platform. A user can be a **guest**, **host**, or **admin**. This role determines their capabilities in the system.

### Attributes

## 🧮 Normalization Procedure

> **📌 Summary:**  
> As part of optimizing the database design, a normalization audit was conducted and documented in `normalization.md`.

> **⚠️ Issue Identified:**  
> The original `properties` table violated **First Normal Form (1NF)** due to the `location` attribute potentially storing non-atomic data (e.g., full addresses or compound region-city values).

> **🔍 Deeper Impact:**  
> Further analysis showed this affected compliance with **2NF** and **3NF**, as some attributes were not fully or directly dependent on the primary key.

> **✅ Resolution:**  
> - A new `locations` table was introduced to store atomic, reusable location data (`city`, `street`).
> - The `properties` table was updated to reference `locations` via a `location_id` foreign key.

> **📂 Reference:**  
> For full details and revised table structures, refer to the file `normalization.md`.

## 🔒 Deletion Rules & Data Integrity

To keep the data in the Airbnb Clone database clean and consistent, certain **deletion restrictions** are enforced using foreign key constraints. These rules prevent accidental loss of important data or broken relationships between tables.

### ⚠️ Key Restrictions:

- **Users with Active Bookings**  
  → Cannot be deleted.  
  _(Guests or Hosts involved in current or past bookings are protected from deletion to preserve history.)_

- **Properties with Active Bookings**  
  → Cannot be deleted.  
  _(Prevents removing listings that are already booked or linked to reviews/payments.)_

- **Locations used by Properties**  
  → Can be deleted, but the location on those properties will be set to `NULL`.  
  _(This avoids breaking the property record while allowing location updates.)_

- **Bookings linked to Payments**  
  → Deleting a booking will also delete its related payment record.  
  _(Handled with `ON DELETE CASCADE` for cleanup.)_

- **Users linked to Messages**  
  → If a user is deleted, their messages will remain, but the sender/recipient fields will be set to `NULL`.  
  _(So chat history isn’t lost even if the user leaves.)_

- **Users or Properties with Reviews**  
  → If deleted, their reviews will also be deleted automatically.  
  _(Helps maintain a clean review system.)_

---

### 💡 Why This Matters:
These rules ensure that:
- No “orphaned” records are left behind.
- Bookings, reviews, and payments stay connected to valid users and listings.
- Important history and financial data are not lost due to accidental deletions.
